# ezloader_bridge
Bridging mod for my EZLoader software to connect to modded servers.

// WARNING // This mod is in very early development!
Currently EZLoader bridge only works for Minecraft version 1.20 on fabric. More fabric versions will be supported shortly but forge support will come at a later date.
Neoforge + quilt + other modloaders will be after that, not sure when.
